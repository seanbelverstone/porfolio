# Sean Belverstone Portfolio

## Description
I set out to create this portfolio to demonstrate the skills that I've picked up and developed over the years since becoming
a developer.
With the exception of two components - the Projects book and the About picture block - everything on the page is custom-made. It is my intention to replace the last two libraries with my own version. One intent I have is by making the Projects book in Unreal Engine 5, but that will take some time.

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- React
- MaterialUI
- react-pageflip
- react-responsive-carousel

## Install Instructions
If you'd like to install this portfolio and run it locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the porfolio from the [repository](https://github.com/seanbelverstone/portfolio2022).
2. Run `yarn` to install all of the packages.
3. If you'd like to include the testing for sending an email from the contact page, create an account on [Email JS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and follow their instructions to get set up, and create a template.
4. Add the user ID as a value to your own `.env` file under the key of `REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER_ID`
5. Run the project with `yarn start` and it should display in your browser of choice.

## Plans For The Future?
As mentioned before I'm currently studying Unreal Engine 5 and plan to use create an interactable book to display my projects, which I'll embed inside the Projects page using Pixel Streaming. If you want to check it out and see what kind of work it'll take, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/pixel-streaming-in-unreal-engine/). It's very exciting and will take some serious man-hours before I'm proficient enough to make it work, but I love learning new things.

Aside from UE5 I intend to revisit my portfolio regularly, to make changes and ensure that it remains up-to-date with all the new features that are releasing and implementing new pieces of knowledge that I obtain over the course of my coding career.
